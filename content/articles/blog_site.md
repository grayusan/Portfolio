Several months ago, my friend produced a portfolio website with Nuxt.js on github pages. I was heavily inspired by the idea of that and started working on my very own portfolio. At the time, I did not have enough knowledge of front-end; therefore I had to learn everything from scratch. Overall it was a good practice and I am satisfied with the quality of this portfolio site. 

## How this blog&portfolio site was created with Nuxt.js

I got the idea several months ago when I saw my friend's portfolio. Since then, I started working on the project. 

### Main technology
Nuxt.js with nuxt content

### Processes
It was not very difficult to create this portfolio sicne this is a typical Nuxt.js project and I had a plenty of examples on the internet. I suffered with CSS the most because of my poor knowledge of front-end. At first, I used svg files for my front page but later decided to remove the file because there was an unknown error which caused an unexpected size changes of the file. 

Routing of pages was quiet challenging because it produced a countless number of errors. 

### Points to improve
Currently, articles for both portfolio and blog are in the same directory and it will cause a complication as the number of articles incraese. To add on this, images cannot be uploaded on the portfolio now because their sizes are not automatically minimized when they are uploaded.
